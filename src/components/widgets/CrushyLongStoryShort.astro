  At Crushy Social Inc., based in the vibrant city of Vancouver, Canada, we believe in the power of genuine connections.
  Crushy is more than just an app—it’s a mission to change the market once and for all.
  <br />
  <br />
  This journey started with a personal story. My mom (R.I.P.) is a huge reason this company exists. When my parents divorced
  years ago (my brother and I were teenagers), she struggled to find a new partner—someone who would truly care for her.
  Over 15 years ago, I suggested she try online dating. At that time, there were no dating apps, only websites. Even then,
  they charged outrageous fees just to match people with the wrong partners. I remember telling her that someone should make
  this more affordable. Finding a partner should be free! (Or at least affordable, considering server costs.)
  <br />
  <br />
  Years later, Tinder and Bumble exploded in popularity. Tinder alone makes over $2 billion per year while failing to foster
  real connections. They don't care. Users have no choice but to pay—starting at $15 USD per week! In reality, not much has changed. And that’s
  why I decided to take action.
  <br />
  <br />
  For the past 16 months, I’ve been building Crushy—a friend and date-finder app designed to disrupt the market. In today's
  fast-paced world, meeting new people can be daunting, and premium features shouldn’t be a barrier to forming meaningful
  relationships. Crushy is your ally in the quest for friendship and love, offering you the tools to connect without breaking
  the bank.
