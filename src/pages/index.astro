    <Fragment slot="content">
        Crushy was born out of one simple truth: meeting people shouldn't suck. Whether you're looking for a date, a friend, or just someone who also thinks pineapple on pizza is a crime, Crushy connects humans—without the cringe.
        <br /><br />
        We ditched the endless swiping, added perks (literally—discounts at cool spots), and made an app that actually feels good to use.
        <br /><br />
        Headquartered in Canada (yes, we say sorry a lot), Crushy is on a mission to help people connect in meaningful, fun, and refreshingly new ways.
