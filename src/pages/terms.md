Please read these terms and conditions carefully before using Our Service.


**Effective Date:** July 15, 2025

Welcome to Crushy. These Terms govern your use of our app and services. By using Crushy, you agree to these Terms.

#### 1. **Eligibility**

You must be 18+ and legally able to enter into contracts. No bots or fake profiles.

#### 2. **Child Safety and Protection**

At Crushy, we are committed to creating a safe environment for all users, especially minors. We strictly prohibit any form of Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE), which includes but is not limited to grooming, sextortion, trafficking, or any behavior that endangers or sexually exploits children.

We also have a zero-tolerance policy for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). CSAM refers to any visual depiction — including photos, videos, or computer-generated imagery — that shows a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Possession, distribution, or production of CSAM is illegal and strictly forbidden on our platform.

We actively monitor for such content and behavior using automated tools and manual review processes. Any violations will result in immediate account termination and will be reported to relevant authorities, including the Canadian Centre for Child Protection (CCCP), the RCMP's National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre (NCECC), and other law enforcement agencies as required.

If you encounter any content or behavior that may involve CSAE or CSAM, please report it immediately through our in-app reporting tools or by emailing [hi@crushy.social](mailto:hi@crushy.social)

You agree not to:

You own your content but grant us a license to display and use it within the app. We may remove content that violates these terms.

#### 6. **Account and Security**

You're responsible for your account security. Report unauthorized use immediately. We may verify your identity and age as required.

#### 7. **Age Verification Process**

To ensure user safety and compliance with our 18+ age requirement, we may require age verification at our discretion. Our current verification process requires you to upload a clear photo of yourself holding a piece of paper with the word "crushy" and today's date written on it. This verification photo will be manually reviewed and compared with your profile photo by our team to confirm your identity. The verification process helps protect our community and ensures all users meet our minimum age requirements. Verification photos are used solely for age confirmation purposes and are handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy. We may ask for more proof in case your age is not obvious.

#### 8. **Paid Features**

Some features require payment. All sales are final unless stated otherwise. Subscriptions auto-renew unless canceled through your app store account.
