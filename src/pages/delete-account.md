Alternatively, you can email us at [hi@crushy.social](mailto:hi@crushy.social) with the phone number linked to your account and a request for deletion. We'll confirm and delete your data within 30 days.

### What Data Is Deleted

- All personal info (e.g. phone number)
- Analytics linked to your account

**Note:**
