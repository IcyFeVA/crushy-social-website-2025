Crushy is a platform built on trust, safety, and respect. This policy outlines our approach to moderating user-generated content, including images, messages, and profiles.

#### 1. **User Responsibility**

Users are solely responsible for the content they upload or share on Crushy. This includes:

* Photos
* Bios
* Messages

Users must not share content that is:

* Non-consensual (e.g., someone else's photo without permission)
* Explicitly sexual involving minors (including suggestive content)
* Hate speech, harassment, or bullying
* Violence or threats
* Illegal or promoting illegal activity

#### 2. **Nudity & NSFW Content**

Crushy allows **non-explicit nudity** in albums when using "Crushr-Mode", but we strictly **prohibit**:

* Genital exposure for profile pictures
* Sexually explicit activity
* Pornographic content

We reserve the right to remove any content that violates this or makes others feel unsafe.

#### 3. **Moderation Methods**

* **Automated filters** detect known offensive material (e.g., nudity, hate symbols).
* **Community reports** are reviewed by our moderation team.
* **Manual reviews** are conducted on flagged content.

We may blur or restrict visibility of certain content while under review.

#### 4. **Two-Strike Policy**

* **1st offense:** Warning and content removal
* **2nd offense:** Account termination

In severe cases (e.g., illegal content), we may act immediately and notify law enforcement.

#### 5. **Appeals**

Users may appeal a moderation decision by contacting [hi@crushy.social](mailto:hi@crushy.social). We aim to respond within 3 business days.

#### 6. **Feedback & Transparency**

Weâ€™re committed to fair and respectful moderation. If you believe something is unfair or unclear, we want to hear from you.
