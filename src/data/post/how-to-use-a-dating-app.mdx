## Rethinking Dating Apps: It’s Time to Change the Rules

Dating apps are everywhere, and they’ve become a huge part of how people meet today. Apps like Tinder and Bumble are masters of keeping users engaged, and for them, that’s the goal. Bumble’s 24-hour rule? It’s designed to keep you coming back. Tinder’s endless monetization strategies? They’re built to drain your wallet as you swipe, match, and chat. But here’s the thing: are these apps helping us build real connections, or are they just playing us?

I believe dating apps should focus on connecting people, plain and simple. They shouldn’t be about turning your love life into a daily to-do list or squeezing out every dollar with premium features. Instead, they should act as a bridge—a way to meet, talk, and then take things offline.

Sure, chatting on an app can be convenient, but let’s not forget the beauty of actual human interaction. Why not make a phone call? Or even better, a video chat? It’s 2025, after all. And once you’ve made that initial connection, meet up in real life. A good dating app should encourage this. It shouldn’t keep you stuck in a never-ending loop of small talk and endless swiping.

In a blog post I wrote earlier, I mentioned that if people find what they’re looking for on our app, then we’ve done our job. And that’s what matters. It’s not about raking in hundreds of millions of dollars or creating a system that thrives on people’s loneliness. The goal is simple: help people connect and step out into the real world, together.

Dating apps don’t need to be a hamster wheel of swipes and notifications. They can be something better. They can be a tool that makes the digital world a stepping stone to real-life relationships, not a trap that keeps us staring at our screens.

It’s time to rethink the way we use these platforms. Let’s make dating apps about connection, not addiction.
