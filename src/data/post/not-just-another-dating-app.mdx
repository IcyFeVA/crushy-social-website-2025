## More than you think

When people hear about a new dating app, they often roll their eyes and think, "Great, another one?" We get it. The online dating space is crowded, frustrating, and often feels like a never-ending cycle of swiping with little real-world success. But Crushy isn’t just another dating app—we’re here to bridge the gap between online connections and real-life experiences.

Unlike traditional dating platforms that keep you glued to your screen, we believe the best relationships are formed beyond the app. That’s why Crushy is actively working to partner with real-world dating events and social gatherings. Whether it’s speed dating nights, singles meetups, or unique experiences like wine tastings and hiking groups, we want to give our users more ways to meet potential matches—both online and offline.

Think of Crushy as your all-in-one hub for modern networking. Not only can you find compatible matches within the app, but you’ll also have access to curated events where you can meet like-minded people in a more natural setting. We don’t see real-world dating events as competition—they complement what we do. And by bringing the best of both worlds together, we’re making dating more dynamic, fun, and ultimately more successful.

Stay tuned as we roll out more partnerships with event organizers in Vancouver and beyond. If you know of an amazing singles event, let us know—we’d love to collaborate and make Crushy the go-to platform for real connections.
