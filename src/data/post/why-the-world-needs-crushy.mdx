## Building Crushy: It's personal

Hello there! Pascal here, founder of Crushy. I want to take a moment to share something deeply personal about this app and why it means so much to me. Crushy isn’t just another app to swipe through profiles—it’s my life’s work, born out of a vision to change the dating and friend-finding game for the better. Let me explain why this mission matters so much and why Crushy exists.

### A Market Gone Sideways

We’ve all seen it: the dating app market today feels more like a high-stakes casino than a place to find genuine connections. Apps promising love or friendships often hide their best features behind paywalls, and let’s face it, those subscriptions aren’t exactly pocket change. You’re left wondering if they even *want* you to succeed—because the longer you’re looking, the more you’re paying.

That’s not how it should be. I believe connection is a basic human need, not a luxury item. And that’s why I’ve poured my heart and soul into Crushy—to give people the tools they need to find meaningful friendships or love without breaking the bank.

### What Makes Crushy Different

Most of the features that other apps make you pay for will be absolutely free. No strings attached. You’ll be able to search and filter, and explore potential connections without being pressured to fork over your hard-earned cash. And for those who want a little extra—like advanced AI matching or profile boosts—we’ll offer premium features at a truly affordable subscription price.

Why? Because helping people find each other shouldn’t come with a giant price tag. Whether you’re looking for a friend to grab coffee with or a partner to share your life with, Crushy is designed to be accessible to everyone. Inclusivity is key, and we want to build a community where everyone feels welcome.

### A Mission to Change the Game

The ultimate goal? To upend the way this industry works. Crushy isn’t here to make you stick around forever—in fact, I hope you don’t need us for too long. If you find your best friend or the love of your life and delete the app, we’ve done our job right.

It’s about creating a community where people feel supported, empowered, and maybe even a little less alone in their journey. Because when connection becomes affordable and authentic, magic happens. And that magic… well, it’s why I wake up every day to keep building Crushy.

### A Personal Note

I’ll be honest: this journey hasn’t been easy. As someone pouring everything into making this dream a reality, there have been late nights, tough decisions, and more snacks than I care to admit. But knowing that Crushy might help someone meet their forever person or their ride-or-die friend? It makes it all worth it.

So here’s my ask: if you believe in this mission, give Crushy a try. Share it with friends. Let’s prove that a dating and friend-finding app can be fair, affordable, and built on genuine care. Together, we can change this market—once and for all.

Thanks for being part of this journey. Here’s to connections that matter!

With heart,
Pascal
